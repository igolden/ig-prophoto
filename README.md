A PSD to HTML project sample. It's built on Jekyll w/ jekyll-assets.

*Note - due to an update during the course of this project, we've set Jekyll to 2.0.0, since it caused breaks with Jekyll Assets. 

Be sure to run 'jekyll serve --watch' to enable regeneration'



Setting up:

1. Copy _config-sample.yml to _config.yml. Change any relative config in there.

2. Run b && bower install to install the bundled assets and bower components.

3. Jekyll-Assets is built on sprockets, which is used in rails. You can include assets in the _assets folder, just like you would in rails.
