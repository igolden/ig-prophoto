How to Submit a Pull Request
---

Before you start working on a branch (WP, for example), create a new branch with the following naming convention: username/focus-of-work.

For example: I'm working on adding a sidebar to the Wordpress theme. Branch is named igolden/adding-sidebar.

1. Finish your relevant changes in the code, and commit to your working branch.

2. Go to the repo on github.com, and click the pull requests button on the right sidebar, and then on the PR page click 'new pull request'.

3. Select the branch you want to merge into a more primary branch (igolden/adding-siderbar to WP)

The Pull Request is submitted, I'll review code and merge into the main working branch.
